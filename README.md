About
------

This web-application will build a small CMS.

The CMS will have a frontend and an admin area. Everything that is visible in the frontend should be manageable from the admin interface.

Some core elements.

Navigation: This is tree of nodes ParseObject("Navigation")

with the following properties

0. id: automatically generated by Parse
0. parent_id:  either null or empty or a valid Navigation id
0. name:  This is what shown in the menu
0. slug: This is what is used in the url
0. title: The title of the url
0. description: The meta description of the url


Pages: This is the content part

A page can be shared by different navigation elements

Pages have the following properties

0. id: automatically generated by Parse
0. name: something to tell the webmaster what the page does
0. data: The content of the page



The goal is to use as much capabilities of Parse.com as the SDK can provide. This will help to both demonstrate the usage and to find bugs.

This web application is for a photo album site where registered  users can create albums and add photos. Other users can see and comment on photos.

The app should touch the following features.

0. Signup  
0. Login
0. Session
0. Caching
0. Parse Objects 
0. Object relations (pages belong to one or more navigation element, comments belong to users etc)
